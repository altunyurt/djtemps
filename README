djtemps aims to ease  Django - Jinja2 templates integration. 

Usage:
------------------------------------------------------------

Simply add the following line to your imports:

    from djtemps import render_to_response

and you're done. 

Ifyou want to use additional filters, extensions or methods within your templates
add any of the following lines to your settings.py 


    JINJA_EXTENSIONS = ['name.of.your.extension.module1', 'name.of.your.extension.module2.' ... ]
    JINJA_FILTERS = ['name.of.your.filter.method1', ...]
    JINJA_METHODS = ['name.of.your.method', ...]


names must be strings, in module name format. such as 
        
    JINJA_METHODS = ['djtemps.jinja_methods.enum', 'djtemps.jinja_methods.url_for', 
                        'djtemps.jinja_methods.pagination', 'djtemps.jinja_methods.logger']

By the way djtemps provides the 4 method above by default, just state them in your settings file
as mentioned. Methods are plain python functions. For filter and extension structure,  you'll need 
to look at the jinja documents. 

If you want to enable translations in jinja2 templates, copy the management directory in this package 
to your apps' directory (your_project/app/management) as a whole and issue the following command 
(for french ie):

    ./manage.py makemessages -l fr -e .jinja
